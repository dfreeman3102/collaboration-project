# Five Dudes Pizza

## Description

A local pizzaria chain needed an interactive website that allowed their customers to order pizzas online. They needed to minimize time spent taking pickup orders over the phone. Online orders would save time and labor which allows more customers to be served. The website will showcase the pizzas along with descriptions, prices, pictures, and nutrional information. An about me page is also created to give additional information about the company.
